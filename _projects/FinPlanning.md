In 2017, I was hired by an investment advisory firm to work as a Backoffice. Along with my duties, I tried to generate some improvements for the commercial side of the business, taking care of repetitive processes and improving them as much as possible.

Many people used spreadsheets to provide customer service as a way to obtain information about their customers' financial lives in an organized manner. This would make it easier to adjust a proposal, based mainly on the customers' needs, but also to identify opportunities not yet seen in other contacts.

I saw some of the spreadsheets and, in partnership with a CPF, we ended up creating a lean tool that already drew a general picture of the client's financial life.

Thanks to this improvement, we had to open an area dedicated exclusively to insurance, which significantly improved the financial results of less experienced investment advisors.

    In the image you can see the two pages of the spreadsheet. Where there is the form on one side and the output on the other. It was only made in Portuguese, as the target audience was only Brazilian investors.

The above output was the input needed for financial planning professionals to find business opportunities, such as insurance, health plans, and retirement plans. The impact on revenue and NPS was remarkable and I ended up getting promoted.
