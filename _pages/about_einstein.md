Hello! I'm Pablo Diego Pereira, 35 yrs, married, and I'm excited to introduce myself as a data analysis and investment advisory professional with a strong background in economics and a passion for technology, cryptocurrencies, and financial planning. With over 5 years of experience as a Registered Investment Advisor at XP Investimentos and a CoFounder Investment Advisor at [Meta Investimentos](http://invistameta.com.br), I have honed my skills in personal financial planning, investments, and analytics.

My educational journey includes a Bachelor's degree in Economics from UFRJ and an ongoing MBA in Data Science and Analytics from USP/Esalq and Google Analytics Certification Course, which will further enhance my expertise in making data-driven decisions. I hold various certifications, including PQO (BM&FBovespa), Specialist Advisory (Proseek), AAI (Ancord), and FBB100 (FEBRABAN), all of which reflect my commitment to excellence in the Brazilian financial market.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in various roles, from Back Office Manager to Marketing and Communications Associate at AIESEC. These experiences have equipped me with a diverse skill set that complements my core expertise in investment advising and data driven decisions.

I am genuinely passionate about economics, investments, technology, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, and I'm eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to provide innovative and data-driven solutions to clients and organizations.
